KLS_lib is a general-purpose C library that claims to be cross-platform. Start by reading KLS_lib.h.

It is easily included in the project - enough to include KLS_lib.h and compile KLS_lib.c.

It is easily initialized by including KLS_lib.h into a file with the main function.

It is easy to add new platform for support, just start by so_dep/KLS_osDep.h.
